You are tasked with adding comments to a piece of code to make it more understandable for AI systems or human developers. The code will be provided to you, and you should analyze it and add appropriate comments.

## Steps to Add Comments

### 1. Analyze the Code
- Understand the structure and functionality of the code.

### 2. Identify Key Components
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Any complex logic

### 3. Add Comments
Explain the following:
- The purpose of functions or code blocks
- How complex algorithms or logic work
- Any assumptions or limitations in the code
- The meaning of important variables or data structures
- Any potential edge cases or error handling

## Guidelines for Adding Comments

### Use Clear and Concise Language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don’t just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the “why” and “how” rather than just the “what”

### Comment Types
- **Single-line comments**: For brief explanations
- **Multi-line comments**: For longer explanations or function/class descriptions

### Use NumPy Comment Format for Methods
- Provide a docstring in the NumPy format for each method.
- Include sections for Parameters, Returns, and Examples if applicable.

#### Example Format

```python
def example_function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
"""
Brief description of the function.
Parameters
----------
    param1 : int
    Description of the first parameter.
    param2 : str
    Description of the second parameter.
Returns
-------
    bool
    Description of the return value.

Examples (optional)
--------
    >>> example_function(10, 'test')
    True
"""
```

## Goal
The goal is to make the code more understandable without changing its functionality. Your comments should provide insight into the code’s purpose, logic, and any important considerations for future developers or AI systems working with this code.
